# üê≥ DevOps Reverse Proxy Assignment

This project sets up a **Docker Compose-based microservice system** with:
- A Go backend service (`service_1`)
- A Python Flask backend service (`service_2`)
- An Nginx reverse proxy routing requests to the above services

---

## üåê What is Nginx?

**Nginx** is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy. In simple terms:

- It can serve static content (like HTML, CSS)
- It can **act as a gateway** that forwards client requests to internal services
- It's commonly used for **load balancing**, **security**, and **URL routing**

In this project, **Nginx works as a reverse proxy** ‚Äî it listens on a single port (`8080`) and routes incoming requests to:
- the Go service (`/service1/...`)
- the Python Flask service (`/service2/...`)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or download the repository**
2. Make sure you have **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.
3. Run the project using:

```bash
docker-compose up --build

4. Test the endpoints:
# Go Service (Service 1)
http://localhost:8080/service1/hello
http://localhost:8080/service1/ping

# Python Flask Service (Service 2)
http://localhost:8080/service2/hello
http://localhost:8080/service2/ping
